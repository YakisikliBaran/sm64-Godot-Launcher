# sm64-Godot-Launcher
An launcher/builder for sm64-port and alike.
Made in the Godot Engine.
Currently only supports building projects for Linux(however you probably should be able to build the launcher for other platforms).
The launcher assumes that you have already installed the required dependencies for the project/repo correctly.
+ make sure the mv command is available before building any projects as the launcher uses it to rename files.
